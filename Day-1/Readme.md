### Task
1. Declare 3 variable: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your variables.
3. Use the "+" Operator to perform the following operations:
    * print the sum of "i" plus your int variable on a new line
    * print the sum of "d" plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    * Concatenate "s" with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
### Algorithm
in this time challange we aimed to find out the type of dat in the programming language and sum both. so we have a algorithm like this. <br />
